# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

## Description

This project focuses on variables, conditional statements, and loops in C. It covers how to declare and use variables, how to use `if`, `else`, and `while` statements, and how to write programs that use these constructs effectively.

### Learning Objectives

#### General

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them.
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them.
- What the `if`, `if ... else` statements are and how to use them.
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`.
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`.
- How to use the `while` loop.
- How to use variables with the `while` loop.
- How to print variables using `printf`.
- What is the `ASCII` character set.
