# 0x1C-makefiles

## Description

This project focuses on Makefiles, a tool used to manage the build process of a project. It covers how to write Makefiles, how to define rules and dependencies, and how to use variables and functions in Makefiles.

| Task Name                      | File                                             | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create your first Makefile     | [0-Makefile](./0-Makefile)                       | Writes a Makefile that builds an executable from `main.c` and `holberton.c`.                   |
| Variables in Makefile          | [1-Makefile](./1-Makefile)                       | Writes a Makefile that uses variables to define the compiler and source files.                 |
| Rules in Makefile              | [2-Makefile](./2-Makefile)                       | Writes a Makefile that defines rules to compile object files and link them into an executable. |
| Dependencies in Makefile       | [3-Makefile](./3-Makefile)                       | Writes a Makefile that defines dependencies between source files.                              |
| Clean rule in Makefile         | [4-Makefile](./4-Makefile)                       | Writes a Makefile that includes a `clean` rule to remove object files and the executable.      |
| Advanced Makefile              | [5-Makefile](./5-Makefile)                       | Writes an advanced Makefile that includes variables, rules, dependencies, and a `clean` rule.  |
| Makefile with custom variables | [100-Makefile](./100-Makefile)                   | Writes a Makefile that uses custom variables for the compiler, source files, and object files. |
| Island Perimeter               | [5-island_perimeter.py](./5-island_perimeter.py) | Writes a Python function that returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`.         |
