# 0x10-variadic_functions

## Description

This project focuses on variadic functions in C. It covers how to define and use variadic functions, how to handle variable arguments, and how to apply these concepts to solve problems effectively. The project aims to provide a deep understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.
