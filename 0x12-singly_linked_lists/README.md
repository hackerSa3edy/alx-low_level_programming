# 0x12-singly_linked_lists

## Description

This project focuses on singly linked lists in C. It covers how to define and use singly linked lists, how to traverse and manipulate them, and how to apply these concepts to solve problems effectively. The project aims to provide a deep understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.

### Tasks

| Task Name                 | File                                   | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Print list                | [0-print_list.c](./0-print_list.c)     | Writes a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.               |
| List length               | [1-list_len.c](./1-list_len.c)         | Writes a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list. |
| Add node                  | [2-add_node.c](./2-add_node.c)         | Writes a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.      |
| Add node at the end       | [3-add_node_end.c](./3-add_node_end.c) | Writes a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.            |
| Free list                 | [4-free_list.c](./4-free_list.c)       | Writes a function that frees a `list_t` list.                                    |
| The Hare and the Tortoise | [100-first.c](./100-first.c)           | Writes a function that prints a message before the `main` function is executed.  |
