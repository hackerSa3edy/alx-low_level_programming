| Multiple mains           | [0-main.c](./0-main.c)                                 | Tests a function that prints if an integer is positive or negative.                                                      |
| Like, comment, subscribe | [1-main.c](./1-main.c)                                 | Comments out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.             |
| 0 > 972?                 | [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c)             | Fixes the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case. |
| Leap year                | [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c) | Fixes the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.         |
