# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

## Description

This project focuses on advanced usage of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. It covers how to manipulate data using pointers, how to work with multi-dimensional arrays, and how to handle strings more effectively. The project aims to deepen your understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.
