# 0x14-bit_manipulation

## Description

This project focuses on bit manipulation in C. It covers how to use bitwise operators to manipulate data at the bit level, how to perform common bitwise operations, and how to apply these concepts to solve problems effectively. The project aims to provide a deep understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.

| Set Bit                        | [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c)                   | Writes a function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.                                     |
| Clear Bit                      | [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c)               | Writes a function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index.                                     |
| Flip Bits                      | [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c)               | Writes a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. |
| Check Endianness               | [100-get_endianness.c](./100-get_endianness.c) | Writes a function that checks the endianness.                                                               |
