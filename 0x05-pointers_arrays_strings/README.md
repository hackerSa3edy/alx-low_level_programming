# 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

## Description

This project focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings in C. It covers how to use pointers to access and manipulate data, how to work with arrays, and how to handle strings effectively. The project aims to provide a deep understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.
