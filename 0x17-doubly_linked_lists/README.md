# 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

## Description

This project focuses on doubly linked lists in C. It covers how to define and use doubly linked lists, how to traverse and manipulate them, and how to apply these concepts to solve problems effectively. The project aims to provide a deep understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.
